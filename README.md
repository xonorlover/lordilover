# Theory
1. i think the internet backbone is the fiber cables under the oceans that hold up and supports the entire internet and without them the internet wouldn't work.
2. a client is software that uses a server that tells the server what to do and a server is either a physical machine that stores data or its software based server that does what the client tells it to do.
3. <img width="493" height="279" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/97deb803-cba5-454a-adae-8b9581878563" /> .
4. The ICP/IP model 4 layer network the use date to communicate over the internet, making client and server relationship by breaking data into packets, sending them to thier destination and putting them back together at their destination.
5. Three examples of internet services that rely on client/server relationships are Gmail, Email and the Cloud.
6. hypertext is text that has a embeded link in it i.e https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yMozrDEqbg .
7. the way the "web" is connected to the internet is the internet is one masssssssssssive web and its all connected, with search engines in the middle and everthing else is connected to them.
