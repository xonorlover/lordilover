# Theory
1. i think the internet backbone is the fiber cables under the oceans that hold up and supports the entire internet and without them the internet wouldn't work.
2. a client is software that uses a server that tells the server what to do and a server is either a physical machine that stores data or its software based server that does what the client tells it to do.
3. <img width="493" height="279" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/97deb803-cba5-454a-adae-8b9581878563" /> .
4. The ICP/IP model 4 layer network the use date to communicate over the internet, making client and server relationship by breaking data into packets, sending them to thier destination and putting them back together at their destination.
5. Three examples of internet services that rely on client/server relationships are Gmail, Email and the Cloud.
6. hypertext is text that has a embeded link in it i.e https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yMozrDEqbg .
7. the way the "web" is connected to the internet is the internet is one masssssssssssive web and its all connected, with search engines in the middle and everthing else is connected to them.
8. A HTTP works by a client such a something like a web browser sends a HTTP request to a sever to ask to get data or info and the sever sends the data or info as a HTML file or as a code
9. HTTP is a unsecure data transfer and a HTTPS is a secure version o HTTP that uses encriptions

$${\color{red}web 1.0 \space is \space mostly \space one \space way \space communication \space between \space the \space website \space and \space the \space user \space.}$$
$${\color{green}web 2.0 \space is \space Two \space way \space communication \space and \space usergenerated \space content \space through \space platforms \space like \space social \space media \space and \space blogposts.}$$
$${\color{yellow}web 3.0 \space is \space a \space More \space personalized \space and \space immersive \space experiences \space that \space focuses \space on \space privacy \space and \space data \space security \space It \space uses \space AI \space \space to \space understand \space user \space intent.}$$
11.1 Web 1.0 is the static web because users mostly just read on the sites and could not easily share or create content.

11.2 Web 2.0 is the social web because creating and sharing content became much easier.

11.3 Web 3.0 is the Semantic web because users use interact with AI content that is much smarter then the other webs.

12. the role that markup languages play in the web are the allow defining content, they enable hypertext and navigation, and they enable data exchange.
13. thee are a few similarities between markup and scripting languages such as they both are readable human and use text based syntax and are both essentil for web  development but they also differnt from each other, markup languages decribe what somthing looks like while scripting languages describe how something works, markup languages lack computer logic while scripting languages are made to prefrom logic.
14. SGML is a framework the defines other markup languages and is the foundation that XML and early versions of HTML were built on,
    
14.1 XML is a subset of SGML and is made to be simpler and is focuses on descrbing data and not how it should be displayed, HTML is an application of SGML and was made specifically for the world wide web,

14.2 XHTML is a reformed version of HTML and XML and the aim of XHTML is to diplay the capabilities of HTML with the extensibility of XML,

14.3 DHTML is not a separate language is tis just a match up of HTML CSS and javascript it allows for animated effects,

14.4 MD is a easy markup languages made for the ease of writing and reading and converting to HTML for display and it prioritizes simplicity and readability over the strict structural definitions

14.5 in summery SGML is the foundational language, XML is a more flexible data-focused descendant of SGML, HTML is the web-specific language, initially based on SGML, XHTML is its XML compliant version, DHTML is a collection of technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) for dynamic web content, Markdown is a separate, lightweight markup language focused on ease of use for text formatting and conversion to HTML.
